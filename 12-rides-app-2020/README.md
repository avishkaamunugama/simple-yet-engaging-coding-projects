A web app which allows customers to book vehicles for a certain period of time and this app also allows the manager to manage the vehicles and schedules. The program is built using React for the front-end , Spring for the back-end and mySql as the database.


## Setup and Usage

Download the zip file, extract it. To run the back-end open the folder as a IntelliJ project and run the Spring program and for the front-end open the app folder in the extracted folder in a code editor (VsCode preferred) and run the app by going to the terminal and entering `npm start`. Hopefully now you should be good to go!
